# Custom VFF Adventurer X1C running on Klipper

A few years ago I bought 2 Flashforge Adventurer 3.  I like the look of the printers, but they can no longer meet my requirements. Now this year I have treated myself to a Bambu Lab X1C and am blown away by the printer. 
In order to continue to have enough printing capacity, especially for small prints available, I now had the idea to raise my Adventurer to the next level and best with cheap and reliable hardware. It doesn't make sense but the play instinct has won. So now I'm going to convert my Adventurers to XY-core printers with Klipper and direct extruder.

The final setup will look like this:
- BTT Mainboard Manta E3EZ with EZ2209 drivers for XY A/B motors
- BTT CB1 with heatsink
- BTT Touch Display 35SPI
- BTT EBB36 CAN Head
- Core mechanic from Voron V0.2r1 with Kirigami bed mount
- Extruder and Hotend from Bambu Lab X1C in a forged custom Voron Mini-Stealthburner
- Housing and power supply from the Flashforge Adventurer 3
