# FF-Adv3-Bambu-BTB

A few years ago I bought 2 Flashforge Adventurer 3.  I like the look of the printers, but they can no longer meet my requirements. Now this year I have treated myself to a Bambu Lab X1C and am blown away by the printer. 
In order to continue to have enough printing capacity, especially for small prints available, I now had the idea to raise my Adventurer to the next level and best with cheap and reliable hardware. It doesn't make sense but the play instinct has won. So now I'm going to convert my Adventurers to XY-core printers with clippers and direct extruders.
